# Tori
Every programmer's battle is with complexity. Chaos expands by itself, while order is a carefully built castle of cards.

Tori will strive to deal one more blow to complexity and chaos. We'll build it on the shoulders of giants, but understanding that giants can see farther - we'll accept this and be humble.

Our humility will mean that we'll walk slower, and with care. Tori will not be static, nor will it strive for it. There can be order in dynamics, and it is often beautiful, such as in music, dance or storytelling.

What story does Tori want to tell, then?

Roughly this: 
- A simple and intuitive-for-everyone syntax to express a programmer's most frequent needs - programs and specifications. 
- A statically typed language with a sound type system and inference. 
- A minimal runtime, but with concurrency and distribution as first-class citizens.
- A "plug-and-play", well documented, intermediate representation, so we can easily translate to any given backend.
